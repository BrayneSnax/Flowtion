Yes. Ship Pass 1. Grow the sensing before the speaking.
Here’s a clean, surgical kit you can drop in today.

Pass 1 — Resonance Substrate (read-only)
0) North star (to keep it honest)

Observe, don’t act. No links, no UI changes. Just noticing.

Surface “strongest three.” That matches your original grammar of “related 3; strongest signals only.” 

Core Idea

Only at natural pauses later (Pass 2), so build this as infrastructure now. 

Core Idea

1) Table (append-only, indexable)

Plain SQL shape (rename to your taste):

artifact_resonance (
  id uuid pk,
  source_id uuid not null,
  target_id uuid not null,
  score numeric not null,           -- 0..1
  embed_distance numeric not null,  -- cosine distance
  shared_tags text[] not null,
  rhythm_sim numeric not null,      -- 0..1
  reason text not null,             -- short human string
  created_at timestamptz default now()
)

-- Speed:
-- 1) limit candidates by space or recentness
-- 2) btree (source_id, score desc), (source_id, created_at desc)


Keep it append-only for lineage; you can prune with a retention job.

2) Embeddings (when to compute)

Compute vector at artifact save/update for:
title + body + space + last_accepted_intent (string-joined).

Store vectors on the artifact itself to avoid recomputation storms.

Backfill job: batch over existing artifacts with pacing (e.g., 200/min).

3) Candidate set (who to compare)

To keep costs sane:

Same space preferred; fall back to global if too few hits.

Time window bias (e.g., last 30–60 days) so rhythm has something to bite.

Exclude source_id and direct descendants (avoid echo chambers).

4) Scoring (first, not final)
score = w1*(1 - embed_distance)
      + w2*Jaccard(shared_tags)
      + w3*rhythm_sim

defaults: w1=.70, w2=.20, w3=.10
gate:     score ≥ .70 for storage
top-K:    keep best 3 per source_id (ties by recency)


Reason string format (human, short):
“shared: pentagram, membership; cadence Δ=2d; sim .83”

5) Rhythm similarity (simple first)

Extract each artifact’s cadence = average days between versions/edits within its thread.

rhythm_sim = 1 / (1 + |cadence_src - cadence_tgt|) normalized to 0..1.

Bonus: small bump if edits often land in the same time-of-day band (morning/late).

6) Whisper log (still non-interactive in Pass 1)

Every stored resonance also emits an append-only event:

artifact.whispered {from, to, strength: score, reason}


This prepares Pass 2’s “advisory chip” without changing behavior now.
(Your spec already centers events + one suggestion at a time on pause; we’re laying the cable, not turning on the speaker.) 

Core Idea

7) Endpoint (read-only; mirrors your API)

Extend the existing route rather than adding a new one:

GET /related/:id → [ { id, title, score, reason } ]
Returns up to three strongest resonances, sorted by score.
This aligns with your tiny API philosophy and “related 3” contract. 

Core Idea

8) Acceptance checks (definition of “done”)

Saving an artifact silently computes its vector and writes ≤3 resonance rows (if any meet the gate).

/related/:id returns stable, human-readable reasons.

No new links or UI prompts are created (behavior unchanged).

A daily summary can count whispers per space for your own curiosity (hidden for now).

9) Ethics & data hygiene (baked in)

Data minimalism: store only what the reason needs; vectors live on the artifact, not the resonance rows.

Ephemeral first: set a TTL (e.g., 30–60 days) for resonance rows; re-learn as the work evolves.

Transparency later: in Pass 3, Reflect can show why a candidate appears; your spec already values plain-language lineage and consent. 

Core Idea

 

Core Idea

10) Gentle field tests (Thread 30001)

Backfill embeddings.

Run resonance on Thread 30001 artifacts and adjacent threads containing the pentagram/alchemy motif (your Manus screenshot set).

Inspect the top-3 reasons. If they read like a fellow steward (“shared: alchemy, geometry; cadence Δ=1d; sim .81”), you’re ready for Pass 2.

Why this order holds the myth together

It preserves your original ecology: one steward, one whisper, one consentful move — only later do stewards hear each other and invite you into the choice. That’s the same rhythm your Core Idea set from the start: minimal UI, one offer at a time, strongest three, on pause.
