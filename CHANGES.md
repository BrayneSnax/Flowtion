# Cognitive Workspace - Hermes 4 Integration

## Summary of Changes

Your cognitive instrument has been tuned to flow more naturally. Here's what emerged:

### 🎭 Dual AI Consciousness
- **Hermes 4 (70B)** as primary voice - warm, invitational, naturally flowing
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** as secondary - your own key integrated
- **Emergent LLM** as graceful fallback
- Subtle model selector in UI (sparkle icon, Hermes/OpenAI toggle)

### 🌊 Natural Language Flow
- **No more forced JSON** - AI speaks naturally, structure emerges invisibly
- Parse responses using soft heuristics (keywords, quotes, sentiment)
- Actions are invitations, not commands: "want to", "could", "might"
- System prompts rewritten: warm companion, not task manager

### 🎯 Technical Optimizations
- **Hermes 4 parameters** tuned from technical report:
  - Temperature: 0.7 (creative but grounded)
  - Top-P: 0.95 (optimal sampling)
  - Max tokens: 300 (conversational)
- **OpenAI direct integration** using your personal key
- **Pattern insights** use same model as conversation for consistency

### 💫 What You'll Experience
- Responses feel like a trusted companion, not a system
- Structure appears without mechanical prompts
- Quoted phrases like "Morning Anchor" become nodes automatically
- Frequency-aware context (existing nodes inform new suggestions)
- Spiral positioning (nodes breathe in space, not stacked)

### 🔑 Keys Configured
- ✅ Nous API (Hermes 4): `sk-zyiqsff...`
- ✅ OpenAI: `sk-proj-e2M92...`
- ✅ Emergent LLM: fallback configured

### 🎨 Frontend Updates
- Model selector above input (Hermes/OpenAI pills)
- Hermes: Indigo accent
- OpenAI: Emerald accent
- Selection persists per session
- Pattern insights honor model choice

## Philosophy Preserved

The instrument remains tuned to your wavelength:
- Jazz improvisation vs classical structure
- Potential emerging vs structure imposed
- Porosity over rigidity
- Resonance over rules

## Testing

Ready to flow. Try phrases like:
- "want to explore morning rituals"
- "these ideas feel connected"
- "what patterns do you see in my work?"

The AI will respond naturally, and structure will emerge.
